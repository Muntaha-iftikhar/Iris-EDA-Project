# Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Internship Project – Arch Teach

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline for classifying iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The project follows industry-standard ML practices including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
